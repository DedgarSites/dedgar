Abstract sockets are a great way for multiple containers in the same OpenShift or Kubernetes pod to communicate with each other, without using any additional storage volumes or network configuration. Since all the containers in a single OpenShift and Kubernetes pod will share the same IPC namespace by default, you can reference a Unix Domain Socket in your program like '@my-abstract-socket', without having to create and keep track of mounth paths.
