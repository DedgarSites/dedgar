My name is Doug Edgar. I'm a site reliability engineer (SRE) at Red Hat, specializing in OpenShift cloud security tooling and DevOps practices. I have over 16 years experience with Linux, with the last 10+ of those being professional for different companies.

I have extensive container development experience, and regularly work with Golang, Operator SDK, Python, Ansible, and cri-o.

My interests are in open source software engineering, web development, and 3D graphics. For advertising opportunities, partnerships, or business inquiries, please feel free to contact me via the <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page.
